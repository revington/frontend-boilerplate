# boilerplate

Justa an (always WIP) personals frontend boilerplate with
* express
* jade
* riotjs
* webpack
* es6 modules

## Structure
UI components are below `client/components/`. Examples of components: header, footer, login form, etc.  
UI containers are below `client/containers`. They *contain* components. For instance the login ~~page~~ container is made from a header, a login form and a footer.

I'm on my way to learn modern UI development with riotjs and jade. Any suggestions will be more than welcome :)
