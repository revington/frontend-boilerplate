# boilerplate

Justa an (always WIP) personals frontend boilerplate with
* express
* jade
* riotjs
* webpack
* es6 modules

## Structure
UI components are below `client/components/`. Right now each `component` is a standalone SPA.
I'm on my way to learn modern UI development with riotjs and jade, and at some point a component will be a component and not an SPA

Any suggestion? Please open an issue :)
